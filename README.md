# Search Replace DB

This script was made to aid the process of migrating PHP and MySQL based websites. It has additional features for WordPress and Drupal but works for most other similar CMSes.

If you find a problem let us know in the issues area and if you can improve the code then please fork the repository and send us a pull request :)

## Usage

1. Migrate all your website files
2. Upload the script folder to your web root or higher (eg. the same folder as `wp-config.php` or `wp-content`)
3. Browse to the script folder URL in your web browser
4. Fill in the fields as needed
5. Choose the `Dry run` button to do a dry run without searching/replacing

### CLI script

The client script will be returning soon once it has been updated to use the new search/replace class.
